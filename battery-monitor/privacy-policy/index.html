  <p><strong>App Name:</strong> Neuron ‚Äì Battery Monitor<br>
     <strong>Developer:</strong> Maria Kishor Eugin<br>
     <strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 30, 2025<br>
     <strong>Privacy Policy URL:</strong>

     </a>
  </p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how Neuron Innovations (‚Äúwe‚Äù, ‚Äúour‚Äù, ‚Äúus‚Äù) handles information when you use the
    mobile application Neuron ‚Äì Battery Monitor (‚Äúthe App‚Äù). We operate the App and are responsible for its processing
    of any user data. You are advised to read this policy carefully before using the App.
  </p>

  <h2>2. What Information We Collect</h2>
  <h3>2.1 Device & Battery-Related Data</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The App collects battery status information (such as power level, charging state, battery health, voltage, temperature) from your device‚Äôs operating system.</li>
    <li>This information is processed entirely on your device and is not transmitted, stored or shared externally.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>2.2 No Personal Identifiers</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not collect personally identifiable information (name, email, phone number, device identifier, location) unless you voluntarily provide it (which this App does not ask).</li>
    <li>We do not use analytics or tracking services that collect personal data or user behaviour.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Since data remains local on your device, we use the battery-related information solely to display current device battery conditions and statistics.</li>
    <li>There is no sharing of data with third parties.</li>
    <li>There is no sale of your data.</li>
    <li>We do not feature personalized advertising or marketing, and no consent is required for that.</li>
    <li>If you uninstall the App, all collected data (which is local only) is removed from your device in accordance with device behaviour.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Permissions & Third-Party Code</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The App may request system permissions (for example to access battery status). These are used only for the core function of monitoring battery status and do not result in data being collected or sent off device.</li>
    <li>We do not embed third-party SDKs that collect personal data.</li>
    <li>If future versions include crash-reporting or analytics SDKs, this policy will be updated accordingly and you will be informed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You may uninstall the App at any time, which terminates any processing.</li>
    <li>You may revoke any permissions at any time via your device settings.</li>
    <li>If you believe we have collected personal data (which we have not), you may contact us at the details below to request deletion or access.</li>
    <li>Please note: As the App does not collect or transmit personal data, many typical rights (such as portability or objection) are not applicable, but you still may contact us.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Consent & Withdrawal</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>By installing or using the App, you consent to this Privacy Policy and to any data processing described herein.</li>
    <li>If you withdraw consent (for example by uninstalling the App or revoking permissions), our processing stops.</li>
    <li>If you continue using the App after changes to this policy, you consent to those changes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Data Minimisation & Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We adhere to the principle of collecting only what is necessary for the core function (battery monitoring).</li>
    <li>We do not collect data beyond that purpose, and no hidden collection occurs.</li>
    <li>Since no data leaves your device, the risk of unauthorized access or transmission is effectively mitigated.</li>
    <li>We do not sell or share your personal or device data with any third parties.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Updates to This Policy</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time (due to new features, regulations or legal obligations).</li>
    <li>We will update the ‚ÄúEffective Date‚Äù at the top of the policy when we do so.</li>
    <li>We will publish the new version at the same URL and highlight any major changes within the App if needed.</li>
  </ul>
