  <h1>Privacy Policy – Neuron Battery Monitor</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 14, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Data Collection and Use</h2>
  <p>
    Neuron – Battery Monitor does not collect, store, or transmit any personal or device data.
    All battery information (such as power, voltage, current, or temperature) is processed locally
    on your device and never sent to any server or third party. We do not collect personal
    identifiers (name, email, phone number, etc.), location or network data, or advertising identifiers.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    Since no data is collected, no information is shared with any external parties, including
    advertisers, analytics services, or cloud providers.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Permissions and Device Access</h2>
  <p>
    The App may request basic system permissions (such as battery status or charging state)
    only to display accurate information about your device’s performance. These permissions
    never transmit or store data externally.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App is suitable for all age groups (rated “3+”). We do not collect personal information
    from any users, including children.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    As no personal data is transmitted or stored, there is no user data exposed to unauthorized access.
    All operations occur entirely on your local device.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Third-Party Services (Huawei AppGallery)</h2>
  <p>
    While our App does not collect or process any personal data, Huawei AppGallery or related Huawei
    services may collect limited information for app distribution, crash reporting, or updates
    according to their own policies.
