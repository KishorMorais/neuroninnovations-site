<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="meta">Last Updated: October 30, 2025</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Neuron Innovations</strong> (“<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use <strong>Brainy – Quiz Zone</strong> and any related websites or applications that link to this policy (collectively, the “<strong>Services</strong>”).</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Monetization:</strong> Google Ads (AdMob) and in-app purchases (e.g., Coins, Ad-Free).</li>
  <li><strong>Accounts/Social:</strong> Google Play Games Sign-In for leaderboards and achievements.</li>
  <li><strong>Analytics/Crash:</strong> We do not use third-party analytics or crash reporting SDKs.</li>
  <li><strong>Gameplay logs:</strong> We do not store or share gameplay logs on our own servers.</li>
  <li><strong>Permissions:</strong> Internet; optional notifications (Android 13+). No location or contacts.</li>
  <li><strong>Audience:</strong> General audiences, including children (age 3+), worldwide.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What We Collect & Why</h2>
<p>We aim to minimize personal data. Most data we process does not directly identify you but may identify your device. Where laws treat such data as personal, we handle it accordingly.</p>

<h3>1) Information you provide directly</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Support:</strong> If you email us, we process your email address and the content to respond and improve the Services.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2) Information we collect automatically</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Device & basic app data:</strong> Device model, OS version, language, app version, and basic technical events necessary to run the app, prevent abuse, and keep features working (e.g., purchase validation, ad delivery/frequency capping for eligible users).</li>
  <li><strong>Advertising identifiers (adults/teen users only):</strong> Google Advertising ID (AAID) may be used by AdMob to show and measure ads and prevent fraud. For child users (see “Children’s Privacy”), we request <em>non-personalized ads</em> and apply Google’s child-directed settings so ad identifiers are not used for personalized profiling.</li>
  <li><strong>Purchases:</strong> From Google Play we receive <em>non-financial</em> purchase confirmations (product IDs, timestamps) so we can deliver items like Coins or Ad-Free. We do <em>not</em> receive payment card details.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3) Information from third parties you choose to link</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Google Play Games:</strong> If you sign in, Google provides your gamer profile (e.g., gamer tag, avatar, and a unique ID) so we can show leaderboards and award achievements. Your leaderboard scores/achievements are stored and processed by Google Play Games Services; we do not host your gamer profile or gameplay logs on our own servers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal Bases (where applicable)</h2>
<p>We process data based on: (i) <strong>consent</strong> (e.g., for personalized ads where required); (ii) <strong>contract necessity</strong> (to provide the game and purchases); (iii) <strong>legitimate interests</strong> (security, anti-fraud, service improvement); and (iv) <strong>legal obligations</strong>.</p>

<h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>The Services are intended for general audiences, including children. We apply the following safeguards:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Ads for child users:</strong> We request <em>non-personalized ads</em> and apply Google’s child-directed treatment so ads are contextual and not based on behavioral profiles.</li>
  <li><strong>Accounts & social:</strong> Features requiring Google Play Games sign-in are intended for users who meet the minimum age required by Google and local law. Child users may play without sign-in; leaderboard/achievement features may be unavailable to them.</li>
  <li><strong>No direct contact data from children:</strong> We do not knowingly collect children’s contact details. If you believe a child provided personal data, contact us and we will delete it promptly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Age thresholds vary by region (e.g., under 13 in the U.S., under 16 in much of the EEA unless local law sets a different age, under 14 in South Korea).</p>

<h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
<p>Purchases are processed by the app store. We receive only what’s necessary to grant items (product ID, time, and a store token/receipt). We do not receive your billing details.</p>

<h2>Ads (Google AdMob)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>For eligible non-child users, AdMob may use the device’s advertising ID to deliver, cap frequency, and measure ads, and for fraud prevention.</li>
  <li>For child users, we request non-personalized ads and apply child-directed flags. Ads are contextual and not based on behavioral profiles.</li>
  <li>You can manage ad preferences on Android: <em>Settings → Google → Ads → Opt out of Ads Personalization</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Permissions We Use</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>INTERNET:</strong> Required to connect to the app store, ads, and Google Play Games.</li>
  <li><strong>POST_NOTIFICATIONS (Android 13+):</strong> Optional. We may send gameplay reminders or updates if you allow notifications in your device settings. You can turn notifications off at any time in system settings.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Retention</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>User-controlled:</strong> You can stop using the app at any time; if you signed in with Google Play Games, you can manage/delete your Play Games profile and related data via your Google account.</li>
  <li><strong>Time-limited:</strong> We do <em>not</em> keep gameplay logs on our own servers. Support emails you send us may be retained as needed to resolve your request and for record-keeping, then deleted or anonymized.</li>
  <li><strong>Extended retention:</strong> Minimal records may be retained as needed for anti-fraud, security, dispute handling, and legal compliance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Your Choices & Rights</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Ads:</strong> Manage ad personalization in your device settings (Android path above). Child users receive only non-personalized ads.</li>
  <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> Control in your device settings.</li>
  <li><strong>Access/Deletion/Correction:</strong> If you signed in with Google Play Games, manage your profile and game data via your Google account. For any data we hold directly (e.g., support emails), contact us at <a href="mailto:neuroninnovations@gmail.com">neuroninnovations@gmail.com</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Consent:</strong> Where we rely on consent, you can withdraw it (for example, by turning off personalized ads in your device settings).</li>
  <li><strong>Complaints:</strong> You may have the right to complain to a supervisory authority in your region.</li>
</ul>

<h2>International Transfers</h2>
<p>We may process data in countries outside your own. Where EEA/UK data is transferred internationally, we use appropriate safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses) as required by law.</p>

<h2>Sharing</h2>
<p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell personal data. We share only with:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> e.g., Google (Play Store, Play Games, AdMob) to operate core features; these parties process data under their policies and our instructions where applicable.</li>
  <li><strong>Legal/compliance:</strong> Where required by law or to protect users and our rights, or in connection with a merger/acquisition.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures (e.g., encryption in transit, access controls) to protect data. No method is 100% secure; please keep your device and accounts secure.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>The Services integrate Google Play Games and Google Ads (AdMob). Their processing is governed by their own privacy policies. We recommend reviewing those policies.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this policy. We will update the “Last Updated” date and, where required, provide additional notice.</p>

<h2>Contact Us</h2>
